# **Financial Product Sales Forecast Model**


1. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

2. MOTIVATION

I have been working in  banking sector for 23 years.  During these years I have gone  through all possible categories within a private network office open to consumers.  From cash desk salesman, table salesman to office management.  Banks, understood as simple mediators or channelers of wealth between the different actors in society, have changed. They have undergone  a transformation, have  evolved and have  adapted to all times,  economic  circumstances and customer's  way of thinking.  As a result of  the  various economic  crises experienced,   the reduction  of interest rates  and therefore the  profits obtained by  these concepts, the pure  business of collecting and  lending money  has ceased  to be the only motivation for this business.  The sale of other financial products such as investment funds,  pension plans and risk insurance, among others, have managed to capture all the importance. The bank has specialized in this type of products, directing all its power and  commercial strategy to the sale of these products by means of the specialized advice to its clients on the part of the employees of the branches.

3. OBJECTIVES AND CHOICE OF MODEL

Investmen Funds, Pension Plans and Insurance of Risk commercialized in banking offices as well as their maintenance in portfolio during 5 years on average, are of great importance within the account of results of an office and by extension of a bank.   In this scenario and through a set of data belonging to 450,000 customers I wanted to develop a predictive model of purchase  of these financial  products.   A predictive classification  model that helps  the entire commercial  force of the  branches to orient the commercialization, to optimize the times, methodologies and systems used. All this in pursuit of greater sales success and customer satisfaction.

4. DATA 

Data comes from the sum of different data sets obtained directly from the financial institution.  ALL  DATA  HAS  BEEN ANONYMIZED.  NAMES AND NUMBER OF INTERNAL  CLIENTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED, NUMBER AND SPECIFICATIONS OF AREA AND OFFICE ADDRESSES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND FINALLY  NAME OF COMMERCIAL MANAGERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.   All these data have been assigned a fictitious identification number, leaving only the data of holding or not holding product by customers.

5. VISUALIZATION - FRONTEND
